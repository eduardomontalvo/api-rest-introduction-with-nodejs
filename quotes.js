    "And that's why I always say, 'shum-shum-schlippety-dop!'","Huntin' a vampire with my grandkids!! FUCK!! TINY RI-I-ICK!!!"," It's not the same, Summer! Lincler's a crazed maniac. He's just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral super-leader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out that ehh-it just adds up to a lame, weird... loser.","Get Schwifty.","So, in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy, hysterical bird-brain homunculi. And I honestly can't even tell the two of you apart half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass—which makes you both identical.","Yeah motherfucker yeah get it get some, right up your fucking bitch ass you fuck! Guess who just discovered a new element! Think you could do that Morty? You think anyonne but me could do it ever in a billion years? Do you think if God existed he could do it? The answer is no. If God exists its fucking me!","Yes, I will! That's right, assholes! Take my penis. Take it all!! And tell Shrimply Pibbles that when the galaxy came calling, Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!","All this time, you've been thinking, 'What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?' Well, now you know, you'd be a doctor. Whoop-dee-doo. You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht, banging Kristen Stewart!","See? Our cup runneth over. Now, who wants to go shopping for a brand-new motherfuckin' world?! All right!","SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MOONMEN! This isn't a musical number! This is a fucking... operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low.","They named a holiday after me. Ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school!","SCREW YOU, RICK! I'LL PURGE YOU TOO, YOU OLD... \"RICKETY\" PIECE OF CRAP! THIS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING! I'M GONNA RIP YOUR FUCKING GUTS OUT AND SMEAR 'EM ALL OVER YOUR FACE! I AIN'T TAKING NO SH-AAAHH!!","We're miserable Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they've weaponized the Eiffel tower!","I don't know, maybe you matter so little that I like you. Or maybe it makes you matter. Maybe I love you. Maybe something about your mother. Don't jump a gift shark in the mouth.","Meh, try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid. And there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.","Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal! I'm a pickle! What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro? I turned myself into a pickle, Morty.","Having a family doesn’t mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for the people that depend on you? Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free.","Morty, you gotta flip 'em off. I told them it means 'peace among worlds.' How hilarious is that!","I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart.","I masturbated to an extra curvy piece of driftwood the other day!","I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!","My life has been a lie! God is dead! The government's lame! Thanksgiving is about killing Indians! Jesus wasn't born on Christmas! They moved the date, it was a pagan holiday!","Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I’ve got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I’m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.","And this is why you don't invite a Floopy Doop and a Shmoopy Doop to the same party.","60 for the resonator, and my grandson wants the sex robot.","And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty! Because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty! But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of 'em. And together we're gonna run around, Morty, we're gonna- do all of kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty.","[they both exchange kisses, upping their sexual arousal]","Lick, lick, lick my balls! Ha ha ha, yeah!","Listen, if the situation keeps on darkening, then you gotta do yourself a favor and pop by Pirates Of The Pancreas. I mean, the top priority is to, you know, get you guys out of there, but, I mean, if that becomes impossible then you gotta treat yourself.","Put a saddle on your universe. Let it kick itself out.","You got some of that mermaid puss.","The universe is a little too big to care about something so small.","I'M A PICKLE! I'm pickle Riiiiiick!","Yeah, well, tough titties.","Don't break an arm jerking yourself off, Morty.","Stupid-ass, fart-saving, carpet-store motherfucker.","TO GET R*ugghhb*IGGITY RIGGITY WRECKED SOONN","I'm Doctor Who in this motherfucker! I could be a clone! I could be a hologram! We could clones controlled by robots controlled by special headsets that the real Rick and Morty are wearing while they're fucking your mother!","To live is to risk it all, otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.","All I have are pictures are of me and my friends from school. What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family? It's not like we're Mormon or dying","Get off the high road, Summer! We all got pinkeye because you won't stop texting on the toilet.","No, no, I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Pop-Tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, th-that would be like the scariest place for them to live. Y'know what I mean?","I wasn't born into the God business, I fucking earned it.","I programmed you to believe that.","Whose kidneys are these?","Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing.","I going to daughter your brains out, bitch.","You can't stay mad a guy with this amount of talent.","Must... continue... moving... in... ways... that... lead... to... dying... with... you.","I think you have to think ahead and live in the moment.","There's a lesson here and I'm not going to be the one to figure it out.","I ain't better than shit, Jack","Morty, you know outer space is up right? ","Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack.","I've got an emo streak. It's part of what makes me so rad.","Can somebody just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet.","You guys, are the fucking worst! Your gods are a lie! Fuck you, fuck nature and fuck trees!","Ooh yeah, shame me. At least when I'm disgusting it's on purpose.","[addressing Rick] You and Unity are like... like leggings and mid-calf boots. You think you're great together, but you're just bringing out the worst in each other.","Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They're no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the center of their lives because you're powerful. And then, because they put you there, they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?","Mr. President, if I've learned one thing today, it's that sometimes you have to not give a fuck!","Wait for the ramp, Morty. They love the slow ramp. It really gets their dicks hard","I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don't know if I would personally ever do it.","Listen, Jerry, I don’t want to overstep my bounds or anything. It’s your house. It’s your world. You’re a real Julius Caesar, but I’ll tell you some, tell you how-how I feel about school, Jerry. It’s a waste of time, a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, “two plus two.” The people in the back say, “four.” Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can take a dump or something. I mean, it’s—it’s not a place for smart people, Jerry, and I know that’s not a popular opinion, but it’s my two cents on the issue."
